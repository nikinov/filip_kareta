# Prague Food Guide: Where Locals Actually Eat (Not Tourist Traps)

*After 30+ years of living in Prague and countless meals with visitors from around the world, I've learned that the best Prague food experiences happen where locals eat—not in the restaurants with English menus targeting tourists. Let me share my favorite authentic spots where you'll taste the real Prague.*

## Understanding Czech Cuisine

Before diving into specific restaurants, it's important to understand what makes Czech cuisine special. Our food reflects our history: hearty, warming dishes designed to sustain people through long Central European winters.

### Traditional Czech Staples
- **Goulash (Guláš):** Rich beef stew with paprika and onions
- **Schnitzel (Řízek):** Breaded and fried pork or chicken cutlet
- **Roast Pork with Dumplings (Vepřo-knedlo-zelo):** The national dish
- **Bread Dumplings (Knedlíky):** Essential side dish, not dessert!
- **Sauerkraut (Zelí):** Fermented cabbage, often served warm

### Czech Beer Culture
Czech Republic consumes more beer per capita than any other country. Beer isn't just a drink here—it's a cultural institution and the perfect complement to our hearty cuisine.

## Traditional Czech Pubs (Hospody)

### U Fleků - The Historic Brewery
**Location:** Křemencova 11, New Town
**What makes it special:** Prague's oldest brewery (1499) still brewing their famous dark beer

While technically touristy, U Fleků earns its reputation. The beer is exceptional, the atmosphere authentic, and the traditional Czech band adds to the experience.

**Local tip:** Go for the beer and atmosphere, but eat elsewhere for better food value.

### Lokál - Modern Traditional
**Locations:** Multiple throughout Prague
**What makes it special:** Modern take on traditional Czech pub culture

Lokál revolutionized Prague's pub scene by serving traditional Czech food with modern quality standards. The beer is perfectly poured, and the atmosphere feels authentically Czech.

**Must try:** Fresh Pilsner Urquell and their excellent goulash
**Local insight:** This is where young Czechs go for traditional food

### U Zlatého Tygra - The Literary Pub
**Location:** Husova 17, Old Town
**What makes it special:** Former hangout of writer Bohumil Hrabal and President Václav Havel

This tiny pub serves only beer and simple snacks, but the atmosphere is pure Prague. It's where intellectuals, writers, and locals have gathered for decades.

**Experience:** Order "dvě piva" (two beers) and soak in the authentic atmosphere
**Warning:** No food menu, cash only, and they don't cater to tourists

## Hidden Local Restaurants

### Restaurace Na Kopci
**Location:** Bořivojova 79, Vinohrady
**Why locals love it:** Exceptional traditional Czech cuisine away from tourist areas

This family-run restaurant in the Vinohrady neighborhood serves some of the best traditional Czech food in Prague. The portions are generous, prices reasonable, and the atmosphere genuinely local.

**Signature dishes:**

### Café Savoy - Elegant Tradition
