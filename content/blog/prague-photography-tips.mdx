*As someone who has photographed Prague for over a decade and guided countless photography enthusiasts through the city, I've learned that great Prague photos aren't just about having the right camera—they're about understanding the city's rhythm, light, and hidden perspectives. Here are my insider secrets for capturing Prague's magic.*

## Understanding Prague's Photographic Character

Prague is a photographer's dream, but it's also challenging.
